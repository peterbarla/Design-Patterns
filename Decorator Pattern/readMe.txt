The Pizza class is an interface which will be implemented by PizzaBase and PizzaIngredient.
The PizzaBase will be the concrete component and PizzaIngredient will be a decorator and the Corn,Salami,... will be the concrete decorators which will extend the PizzaIngredient decorator.
As you can see the Code file also contains a JFrame and a JPanel because i wanted to make the whole project visible so when you run the Main,it will draw you the concrete pizza you created by having a bake method which draws on the JPanel the images in the Resources file.
