The purpose of the Abstract Factory is to provide an interface for creating families of related objects, without specifying concrete classes.
The Menu class is responsible for creating a food menu(soup and maindish) and it shows that depending on what concrete factory(ChineseChef pr IndianChef) we choose, it will create a pair of products which make sense only together(chinese soup with chinese maindish and indian soup with indian maindish).
